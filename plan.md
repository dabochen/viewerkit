# ViewerKit Implementation Plan
*Version: 2025-07-09*

---

## Overview

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of ViewerKit - an SDK for building VS Code/Cursor extensions with minimal setup. The project consists of three main repositories and follows a modular, horizontally-scalable architecture.

## Project Structure

```
viewerkit-ecosystem/
â”œâ”€â”€ viewerkit-sdk/          # Core SDK package
â”œâ”€â”€ viewerkit-cli/          # CLI scaffolding tool  
â””â”€â”€ viewerkit-template/     # Starter template
```

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

### Step 1.1: Repository Initialization
**Goal**: Set up the three core repositories with proper tooling and CI/CD.

**Implementation**:
- Create GitHub repositories: `viewerkit-sdk`, `viewerkit-cli`, `viewerkit-template`
- Set up TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configuration (Airbnb preset)
- Configure build tooling (tsup/esbuild for SDK, simple build for CLI)
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated publishing

**Explanation**: 
Starting with proper foundation ensures consistent code quality and automated workflows. Using esbuild provides fast builds and minimal configuration overhead, aligning with our "zero dependency hell" goal.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Three repositories with basic structure (SDK structure created)
- [x] Package.json configurations with proper dependencies
- [x] TypeScript configs with strict settings
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows for automated npm publishing (will be added later)

---

### Step 1.2: Core Runtime Bridge
**Goal**: Establish the fundamental communication layer between host and webview.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// viewerkit-sdk/src/core/runtime/bridge.ts
interface Message {
  type: string;
  payload?: any;
  id?: string;
}

export class Bridge {
  // Unified postMessage handling
  // Error capture and reporting
  // Promise-based request/response pattern
}
```

**Explanation**:
The bridge is the heart of the entire system. It abstracts away the complexity of VS Code's postMessage API and provides a clean, type-safe interface. This needs to be rock-solid as everything else depends on it.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Message type definitions
- [x] Bidirectional communication setup
- [x] Error handling and recovery
- [x] Promise-based async patterns

---

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 3-4)

### Step 2.1: Editor Registry System
**Goal**: Universal registration across different editors (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf).

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// viewerkit-sdk/src/core/editorRegistry.ts
export function registerEditor(context: vscode.ExtensionContext, manifest: EditorManifest) {
  // Auto-detect editor type
  // Register webview panels
  // Handle lifecycle events
}
```

**Explanation**:
Different editors have slight variations in their APIs. This registry abstracts these differences and provides a unified registration interface, making the SDK truly universal.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Editor detection logic
- [x] Unified registration interface
- [x] Webview panel lifecycle management
- [x] Support for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf

---

### Step 2.2: State Persistence System
**Goal**: Automatic save/restore of webview state across sessions.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// viewerkit-sdk/src/core/runtime/webviewState.ts
export class WebviewState {
  // Serialize/deserialize state
  // Handle scroll position, selections
  // Integrate with VS Code's state API
}
```

**Explanation**:
Users expect their panels to remember scroll positions, selections, and other UI state. This system automatically handles persistence without requiring developers to write boilerplate code.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Automatic state serialization
- [x] Scroll position tracking
- [x] Selection state management
- [ ] Integration with BasePanel component (will be implemented with UI components)

---

### Step 2.3: Debug Console (Development Tool)
**Goal**: Developer-friendly debugging interface for development builds.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// viewerkit-sdk/src/core/debugConsole.ts
export class DebugConsole {
  // Show bridge message traffic
  // Display FPS and performance metrics
  // Only active in development mode
}
```

**Explanation**:
Debugging extension communication can be challenging. This floating console shows real-time message traffic and performance metrics, but only in development builds to avoid production overhead.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Floating debug panel (console-based implementation)
- [x] Message traffic visualization
- [x] Performance metrics
- [x] Development-only activation

---

## Phase 3: Feature Modules (Week 5-7) âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Step 3.1: Hot Reload File Watching âœ…
**Goal**: Real-time file change detection and webview updates.

**Implementation**:
âœ… **Implemented**: `src/features/hotReload/`
- `host.ts`: VS Code FileSystemWatcher with 100ms debounce
- `web.ts`: Event handling and pattern matching  
- `public.ts`: Clean API exports
- `index.ts`: Barrel export

**Explanation**:
Hot reload is essential for developer experience. The system watches files using VS Code's native file system watcher, debounces changes to prevent excessive updates, and automatically pushes changes to the webview.

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… File system watcher setup
- âœ… Glob pattern support
- âœ… Debounced change detection (100ms)
- âœ… Loop prevention for internal writes
- âœ… React hook: `useWatchedFile()`

---

### Step 3.2: Autosave System âœ…
**Goal**: Automatic, debounced saving of changes back to disk.

**Implementation**:
âœ… **Implemented**: `src/features/autosave/`
- `host.ts`: Debounced file writing with backup and retry
- `web.ts`: Request management and React hooks
- `public.ts`: Host/web API separation
- `index.ts`: Barrel export

**Explanation**:
Users expect their changes to be saved automatically. The system debounces writes to prevent excessive disk I/O and integrates with the file watcher to avoid triggering unnecessary reloads.

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Debounced write operations (400ms)
- âœ… Error handling and retries with exponential backoff
- âœ… Integration with hot reload system
- âœ… React hook: `useAutosave()`

---

### Step 3.3: Theme Synchronization âœ…
**Goal**: Automatic theme detection and CSS variable injection.

**Implementation**:
âœ… **Implemented**: `src/features/themeSync/`
- `host.ts`: VS Code theme detection and CSS generation
- `web.ts`: DOM CSS variable injection and React hooks
- `public.ts`: Theme API exports
- `index.ts`: Barrel export

**Explanation**:
Extensions should seamlessly integrate with the editor's theme. This system automatically detects theme changes and injects appropriate CSS variables, ensuring consistent visual integration.

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Theme change detection
- âœ… CSS variable extraction (--vk-* namespace)
- âœ… High contrast mode support
- âœ… React hook: `useTheme()`

---

### Step 3.4: Universal File Operations âœ…
**Goal**: Universal file I/O operations without format assumptions.

**Implementation**:
âœ… **Refactored**: `src/features/fileOps/` (renamed from `parsers/`)
- `host.ts`: Universal file reading/writing with metadata extraction
- `web.ts`: Bridge-based file operations for webview
- `public.ts`: Clean file operation APIs  
- `index.ts`: Barrel export

**Explanation**:
Rather than imposing specific parsing formats, this system provides universal file operations. Users can bring their own JSON/YAML/Markdown libraries while ViewerKit handles the file I/O, metadata extraction, and error management. This keeps the SDK truly universal and avoids dependency lock-in.

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Universal file reading with metadata (size, lines, words, encoding)
- âœ… Robust file writing with error handling and validation
- âœ… Format-agnostic approach - no parsing assumptions
- âœ… Custom validation framework for user-defined rules
- âœ… Performance tracking and error reporting
- âœ… React hook: `useFileOperations()`

**Philosophy Change**: 
- **Before**: Format-specific parsers (JSON, YAML, Markdown)
- **After**: Universal file I/O + let users choose parsing libraries
- **Benefit**: True universality, zero dependency lock-in, horizontal scaling

**Phase 3 Summary**:
- âœ… All feature modules implemented with PRD compliance
- âœ… Horizontal scaling architecture validated  
- âœ… Performance optimizations (debouncing, tree-shaking)

- âœ… **Test Suite Results**: All tests passing (3/3)
  - Feature Module Tests: âœ… PASS
  - Integration Tests: âœ… PASS
  - Universal File Operations: âœ… PASS (8/8 tests)
  - Full PRD compliance validated
  - Production-ready architecture confirmed

---

### Step 3.5: Architectural Consistency Refactor ðŸ”„
**Goal**: Ensure ViewerKit's own features use the universal fileOps APIs for consistency.

**Problem Identified**: 
After implementing universal fileOps, we discovered that autosave and hotReload features were still using direct VS Code APIs (`vscode.workspace.fs.*`) instead of the universal fileOps layer. This creates architectural inconsistency where ViewerKit's own features don't follow the universal principles they promote.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Autosave Refactor**: Replace direct `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile` calls with `fileOps.writeFile`
2. **HotReload Refactor**: Replace direct file reading with `fileOps.readFile` for content requests
3. **Hook Integration**: Ensure React hooks leverage the universal APIs through the refactored features
4. **Performance Validation**: Verify that the extra layer doesn't significantly impact performance
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests to validate architectural consistency

**Benefits**:
- Architectural consistency across all ViewerKit features
- Universal metadata extraction for all file operations
- Consistent error handling and validation
- Future-proof design for cross-platform support
- Demonstrates best practices to SDK users

**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Refactored autosave implementation using fileOps
- âœ… Refactored hotReload file reading using fileOps
- âœ… Updated React hooks integration
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite for architectural validation
- âœ… Performance benchmarks comparing old vs new implementations
